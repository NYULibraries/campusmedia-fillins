    <h2 class="message">New Zoom Instruction Equipment in Classrooms (Updated 8/27/2020)</h2>  
    
    ### All classrooms will have a Zoom solution for use during in-person instruction sessions. Visit the [NYU Zoom page](http://www.nyu.edu/it/zoom){: .external} for Zoom Classrooms instructions and demo video.

    Use a personal laptop to connect to the Zoom Box (processor) and the flat panel, or projector, to display content and launch a zoom session. 

    Please do not use the installed AV equipment in classrooms. This equipment is disabled and not functional for fall.

    ### Zoom solutions include:
    * large flat panel monitor or projector
    * video conferencing system with Zoom installed
    * camera, mic, speakers
    * 25 foot HDMI cable
